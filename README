Introduction
------------

This is a project to build an adaptor for using Gamecube controllers
with N64 consoles. The motivation behind this is that the N64 has some
really great games, but the controller hardware is rather bad- the
joysticks wear out quickly, and the layout is odd. The Gamecube
controllers, however, have a superset of the features and a much
better joystick.

A secondary goal of this project is to more thoroughly reverse engineer
the protocols involved and create reusable libraries for interfacing PIC
microcontrollers to N64 and Gamecube devices. The very basics of reverse
engineering the two protocols was done before I started this project,
but I quickly discovered that there's much more to the protocol. I believe
this project may be the first one to completely reverse engineer the
protocol used by standard N64 controllers, including peripherals like the
memory and rumble paks.

All code here is released under the GPL. This means that if you have basic
electronics skills and a way to program the microcontroller, you can build
your own cube64 adaptor easily. The hardware is extremely simple, and all
the complexity of reverse engineering and writing code is done for you ;)


Usage
-----

The completed adaptor plugs into an N64 console, and a gamecube controller
plugs into the adaptor. The default button mapping is as follows:

   Gamecube       N64
  ---------------------
   Analog stick   Analog stick
   D-pad          D-pad
   A              A
   B              B
   Z              Z
   Start          Start
   R end-stop     R
   L end-stop     L
   C-stick        C buttons
   X              C-down
   Y              B

This button mapping is stored in non-volatile memory, and tt may be modified during
gameplay. To change the mapping for one button:

  1. Hold down the L and R buttons down most of the way, but not enough to
     push the end-stop buttons, and press Start.

  2. If you have the rumble power connected, you should feel a brief rumble.

  3. Press the button you wish to remap. This includes the C-stick and D-pad, since
     they emulate buttons.

  4. Press the button you want to map it to. This button is always interpreted
     according to the above defaults, so for example pressing Y here would actually
     map to B. This has the effect that pressing the same button you pressed in step
     3 always resets that button to its default mapping.

  5. If the mapping was successful and you have rumble power connected, you should feel
     a brief rumble.

To reset all mappings to the above defaults:

  1. Hold down the L and R buttons down most of the way, but not enough to
     push the end-stop buttons, and press Z.

  2. If you have the rumble power connected and the reset was successful, you should
     feel a brief rumble.


The adaptor handles calibration in almost the exact same way a Gamecube does. If
your joystick is drifting or nonresponsive during gameplay, you should be able to
recalibrate it by performing any of the following actions without touching the
joystick, C-stick, L button, or R button:

  1. Hold down X, Y, and Start for a couple seconds during gameplay

  2. Unplug the controller from the adaptor and plug it back in

  3. Unplug the adaptor from the N64 and plug it back in

  4. Turn off the N64 then turn it back on. (The reset button won't
     recalibrate, since the adaptor doesn't lose power or get reinitialized)


Hardware
--------

There are currently two versions of the Cube64 hardware:

  - The "Cube64 Basic" uses a very common PIC16F84A microcontroller, and
    requires an external 5V power supply. Just about any electronics hobbyist
    should be able to build it easily. 

  - The "Cube64 Mini" uses a tiny 8-pin PIC12F629 microcontroller, and
    includes a charge pump that generates the 5V supply for the rumble motor.
    It is smaller and more convenient than the Cube64 Basic, but it requires
    a less common microcontroller and a charge pump that's only available
    in surface mount packages.

Both versions of the hardware have the same button remapping features
and responsiveness, as the only difference in their firmware is a few lines
worth of compile-time configuration. You can also of course use the charge
pump circuit from the Cube64 Mini with a PIC16F84A- but if you're using
tiny chips anyway, might as well go all the way ;)


Status
------

The protocol used between the N64 and controller, and between the controller
and controller pak is well-understood now. An RS-232 to N64 bridge and several
Python programs demonstrate just about all of the protocol.

The necessary subset of the protocol has been implemented in the cube64
firmware to emulate an official N64 controller with rumble pak. If 5V power
for the motor can be supplied to the gamecube controller, its rumble motor
will be used to emulate the N64 rumble pak.

It should be possible to emulate the N64 memory pak using the results of my
reverse engineering, but a 20 MHz PIC probably isn't fast enough to run the
CRC algorithm in time to return a status byte to the N64. If a faster
implementation of the CRC is discovered or a processor about twice as fast is
used, the memory pak could be emulated easily.


Contents
--------

  firmware:  Source code for the firmware, in PIC assembly. I develop this
             mostly using the open source "gputils" package, but I occasionally
             test it with MPLAB. The firmware for the adaptor itself is
             "cube64.asm", but there are a few additional test programs
             and libraries.

  hardware:  This includes schematics for the adaptor, in PDF and gschem format.
