==Setting up WinPic800==
  # Install WinPic800 and his driver.
  # Click on "Idioma" on the top menu and put it in whatever language you understand ;).
  # Install your micro-controller into your programmer socket with the first pin of the chip at the top of the socket.
  # Plug your JDM programmer into the serial port of your computer.
  # In WinPic800 go into Setting => Hardware and select JDM Programmer and click "Apply edits".
  # Go into Device => Test Hardware, this should say "Harware Ok". If not check you are using the right COM port. Also using 64bits OS give often trouble. Try programming with 32bits OS instead.
  # On the top right corner of the application select the PIC series and PIC model you want to program.
  # Click on the Open icon and load the .hex file corresponding to the micro-controller you are using.
  # Click on the "Program All" icon to flash the PIC.
  # Your PIC should now contain Cube64-DX!!
